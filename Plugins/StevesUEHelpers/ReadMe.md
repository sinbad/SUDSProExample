# Steve's UE Helper Plugin Library

## Introduction

This is a helper plugin library for [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) (version 4.26+ / 5.0+)
which makes a bunch of things better:

* [New Widgets](doc/Widgets.md)
  * Focusable buttons, menu stacks, control prompts and more
* [Input events](doc/Input.md)
  * Reliable notification when the player changes input method
* [Debug visualisation](https://www.stevestreeting.com/2021/09/14/ue4-editor-visualisation-helper/)
* [Better DataTable Row References](https://www.stevestreeting.com/2023/10/06/a-better-unreal-datatable-row-picker/)
* [Light Flicker](doc/LightFlicker.md)
* [Easing Functions](Source/StevesUEHelpers/Public/StevesEasings.h)
* [Replicated Physics Actor](Source/StevesUEHelpers/Public/StevesReplicatedPhysicsActor.h)
* Halton Sequence based random stream

## Examples

This project contains the master documentation for this library, but if you want
to see examples of its use, see the [Steve's UE Examples](https://github.com/sinbad/StevesUEExamples) project.


## Installing this plugin

### Cloning

The best way is to clone this repository as a submodule; that way you can contribute
pull requests if you want. The project should be placed in your project's Plugins folder.

```
> cd YourProject
> git submodule add https://github.com/sinbad/StevesUEHelpers Plugins/StevesUEHelpers
> git add ../.gitmodules
> git commit
```

Alternatively you can download the ZIP of this repo and place it in 
`YourProject/Plugins/StevesUEHelpers`.

### Referencing in C++

Edit YourProject.Build.cs and do something similar to this:

```csharp

using System.IO;
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class YourProject : ModuleRules
{
	private string PluginsPath
	{
		get { return Path.GetFullPath( Path.Combine( ModuleDirectory, "../../Plugins/" ) ); }
	}

	public YourProject(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
	{
        // Your existing rules
        // ...


		AddStevesUEHelpers();
	}

	protected void AddStevesUEHelpers() {
		// Linker
		PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "StevesUEHelpers" });
		// Headers
		PublicIncludePaths.Add(Path.Combine( PluginsPath, "StevesUEHelpers", "Source", "StevesUEHelpers", "Public"));
	}

```

It's also worth adding `StevesUEHelpers` to your own .uproject as a plugin reference:

```
"Plugins": [
		...
		{
			"Name": "StevesUEHelpers",
			"Enabled": true
		},
		...

```

After adding this you should right-click your .uproject file and "Generate Visual
Studio Project Files". 

You can use most of the features without doing anything else, but certain features
require some additional setup, see below.

### Configure Custom GameViewportClient

This library contains a new `UGameViewportClient` subclass called `UStevesGameViewportClientBase`,
which is used to suppress the mouse cursor in menus then using a gamepad.

Unfortunately UE4's Slate overrides the mouse pointer visibility sometimes, so
this fixes that.

To use it, simply:

1. Open Project Settings
1. Go to Engine > General Settings
1. Change Game Viewport Client Class to StevesGameViewportClientBase

### Configure UiTheme

Some features require you to configure some theme information for the UI, which 
is discussed in more detail in the [UiTheme section](./doc/UiTheme.md).

## Game instance subsystem

In order to track stateful things like the current input mode for each player, 
there is a custom `GameInstanceSubsystem` called `StevesGameSubsystem`, which 
you can tap into anywhere in Blueprints by searching for it:

![Game Instance Subsystem](./Resources/gameinstance.png)

Once you have access to this you can do things like get the latest input device used:

![Game Instance Subsystem](./Resources/lastinput.png)

For more details, see the [Input section](doc/Input.md).
