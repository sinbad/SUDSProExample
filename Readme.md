# SUDS Pro Example Project

This is the example project for [SUDS Pro](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/98046b91d2d4470f8c10db3589b3640e).

## Steve's UE Helpers Plugin

This example uses another one of my open source projects, "Steves UE Helpers", to provide convenient 
features such as better gamepad support and a typewriter text widget. This plugin is open source, but is also 
[provided for free on Fab](https://www.fab.com/listings/6a48c58c-1771-42f6-b46f-2b09e31b1699). 

For convenience this example project uses the Fab version, which you'll need to install. The source code is also
available for those who would prefer it.
